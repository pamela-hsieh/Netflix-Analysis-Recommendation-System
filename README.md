# Netflix-Analysis-Recommendation-System

- This project analyzed a dataset of 12M+ Netflix movie-watching records to build a personalized recommendation system for users.
- Data Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data/data), including movie ratings and titles.



Due to the limitations of our computer's CPU capacity, we decided to work with only two files: 'combined_data_1.txt' and 'movie_titles.csv'. To further reduce the dataset size, we removed rows at even positions.

Additionally, due to limitations of GitHub uploading, 'combined_data_1.txt' was split into 'combined_data_1_1.zip' and 'combined_data_1_2.zip' for easier management and sharing.
